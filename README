NAME
    MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel - emit Excel spreadsheets from Mojo

SYNOPSIS
        use MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel;

        sub startup {
          my $self = shift;

          $self->types->type(xls => 'application/vnd.ms-excel');

          my $self->renderer->add_handler(
              xls => MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel->new
          );
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This renderer converts the "result" element in the stash to an Excel
    spreadsheet. If the stash also has a "heading" element, the renderer
    will also write headings in bold type for the columns in the
    spreadsheet.

    "heading" is an arrayref, while "result" is an array of arrayrefs.

METHODS
  new
    This method returns a handler for the Mojo renderer.
