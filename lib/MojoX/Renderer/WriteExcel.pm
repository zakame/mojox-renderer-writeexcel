=head1 NAME

MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel - emit Excel spreadsheets from Mojo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel;

    sub startup {
      my $self = shift;

      $self->types->type(xls => 'application/vnd.ms-excel');

      my $self->renderer->add_handler(
          xls => MojoX::Renderer::WriteExcel->new
      );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This renderer converts the C<result> element in the stash to an Excel
spreadsheet.  If the stash also has a C<heading> element, the renderer
will also write headings in bold type for the columns in the
spreadsheet.

C<heading> is an arrayref, while C<result> is an array of arrayrefs.
